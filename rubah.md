Rubah
=====

Rubah is the first [Dynamic Software Update](dsu.html) system for Java that is:

* **Portable**, implemented via libraries and bytecode rewriting on top of a
standard JVM
* **Efficient**, imposing negligible overhead on normal, steady-state execution;
* **Flexible**, allowing nearly arbitrary changes to classes between updates;
* **Non-disruptive**, employing either a novel eager algorithm that transforms
the program state with multiple threads or a novel lazy algorithm that
transforms objects as they are demanded, after the update.
