    Checkpoint/rollback (CR) mechanisms create snapshots of the state of a
    running application, allowing it to later be restored to that checkpointed
    snapshot. Support for checkpoint/rollback enables many program analyses and
    software engineering techniques, including test generation, fault tolerance,
    and speculative execution.

    Fully automatic CR support is built into some modern operating systems.
    However, such systems perform checkpoints at the coarse granularity of whole
    pages of virtual memory, which imposes relatively high overhead to
    incrementally capture the changing state of a process, and makes it
    difficult for applications to checkpoint only some logical portions of their
    state. CR systems implemented at the application level and with a finer
    granularity typically require complex developer support to identify: (1)
    where checkpoints can take place, and (2) which program state needs to be
    copied. A popular compromise is to implement CR support in managed runtime
    environments, e.g., the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but this typically
    requires specialized, non-standard runtime environments, limiting
    portability and adoption of this approach.

    In this paper, we present a novel approach for Checkpoint ROllbaCk via
    lightweight HEap Traversal (Crochet), which enables fully automatic
    fine-grained lightweight checkpoints within unmodified commodity JVMs
    (specifically Oracle’s HotSpot and OpenJDK). Leveraging key insights about
    the internal design common to modern JVMs, Crochet works entirely through
    bytecode rewriting and standard debug APIs, utilizing special proxy objects
    to perform a lazy heap traversal that starts at the root references and
    traverses the heap as objects are accessed, copying or restoring state as
    needed and removing each proxy immediately after it is used. We evaluated
    Crochet on the DaCapo benchmark suite, finding it to have very low runtime
    overhead in steady state (ranging from no overhead to 1.29x slowdown), and
    that it often outperforms a state-of-the-art system-level checkpoint tool
    when creating large checkpoints.

    Dynamic analyses such as those implemented by compiler sanitizers and
    Valgrind are effective at finding and diagnosing challenging bugs and
    security vulnerabilities.  However, most analyses cannot be combined
    on the same program execution, and they incur a high overhead, which
    typically prevents them from being used in production.

    This paper addresses the ambitious goal of running concurrently
    multiple incompatible stock dynamic analysis tools in production,
    without requiring any modifications to the tools themselves or adding
    significant runtime overhead to the deployed system.  This is
    accomplished using multi-version execution, in which the dynamic
    analyses are run concurrently with the native version, all on the same
    program execution.

    We implement our approach in a system called FreeDA and show that it
    is applicable to several common scenarios, involving network servers
    and interactive applications.  In particular, we show how incompatible
    stock dynamic analyses implemented by Clang's sanitizers and Valgrind
    can be used to check high-performance servers such as Memcached, Nginx
    and Redis, and interactive applications such as Git, HTop and OpenSSH.

    Multi-Version Execution (MVE) deploys multiple versions of the same
    program, typically synchronizing their execution at the level of system
    calls. By default, MVE requires all deployed versions to issue the same
    sequence of system calls, which limits the types of versions which can be
    deployed.

    In this paper, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to reconcile
    expected divergences between different program versions deployed through MVE.
    We evaluate the DSL by adding it to an existing MVE system (Varan) and testing
    it via three scenarios: (1) deploying the same program under different
    configurations, (2) deploying different releases of the same program, and (3)
    deploying dynamic analyses in parallel with the native execution. We also
    present an algorithm to automatically extract DSL rules from pairs of system
    call traces.  Our results show that each scenario requires a small number of
    simple rules (at most 14 rules in each case) and that writing DSL rules can be
    partially automated.

    Dynamic software updating (DSU) is a technique for patching running
    programs, to fix bugs or add new features.  This paper presents Tedsuto, a
    general testing framework for DSU, along with a concrete implementation of
    it for Rubah, a state-of-the-art Java-based DSU system. Tedsuto uses
    system-level tests developed for the old and new versions of the updateable
    software, and systematically tests whether a dynamic update might result in
    a test failure. Very often this process is fully automated, while in some
    cases (e.g., to test new-version functionality) some manual annotations are
    required.  To evaluate Tedsuto's efficacy, we applied it to dynamic updates
    previously developed (and tested in an ad hoc manner) for the H2 SQL
    database server and the CrossFTP server--- two real-world, multithreaded
    systems.  We used three large test suites, totalling 446 tests, and we found
    a variety of update-related bugs quickly, and at low cost.

    Updating a program is unavoidable to fix bugs, add features, or improve
    performance. This is, however, a disruptive operation that involves stopping and
    restarting the running program, with the side-effect of service downtime and
    data loss. The ability to update a program without stopping it — to perform a
    Dynamic Software Update — is thus increasingly important in a world where
    service downtime and data loss map directly to loss of revenue.

    
    There are, of course, highly-available systems that simply cannot stop and
    already support dynamic updates. These systems, however, rely on redundant
    hardware, already present for fault tolerance, to incrementally update some
    machines while others keep providing the service. These approaches employ
    complex and domain-specific algorithms that restrict the flexibility of updates.
    The research community has focused on this problem and produced a vast body of
    work. However, to date, there is no practical solution for dynamic software
    updating.

    
    In this work, I propose the first practical solution for Dynamic Software
    Updating for languages that run in a managed environment, in particular, Java.
    The approach I propose supports unrestricted changes between successive program
    versions and does not limit the updatable program from using any language or
    runtime feature. Moreover, it does not add any steady-state overhead and
    requires only a short pause in program execution to perform an update (that is
    not proportional to the size of the program state).

    
    I propose updates to be supported explicitly as program features. Therefore, the
    developer needs to change their application to support updating it. The solution
    I propose minimizes the required manual changes and automates most of the code
    that describes each update. Furthermore, given that the developer may
    inadvertently introduce errors, only visible during the update process, the
    approach I propose provides a way for the developer to re-use existing system
    tests, and write new ones, that ensure that the updated program behaves as
    expected after an update.

    Bug-finding tools based on dynamic analysis (DA), such as Valgrind or the

    prohibitively expensive to use in production. In this work, we investigate the
    exciting possibility of deploying such dynamic analyses in production code,

    This paper presents Rubah, the first dynamic software updating system for Java
    that: is portable, implemented via libraries and bytecode rewriting on top of a
    standard JVM; is efficient, imposing essentially no overhead on normal,
    steady-state execution; is flexible, allowing nearly arbitrary changes to
    classes between updates; and is non-disruptive employing either a novel eager
    algorithm that transforms the program state with multiple threads, or a novel
    lazy algorithm that transforms objects as they are demanded, post-update.
    Requiring little programmer effort, Rubah has been used to dynamically update
    five long-running applications: the H2 database, the Voldemort key-value store,
    the Jake2 implementation of the Quake 2 shooter game, the CrossFTP server, and
    the JavaEmailServer.

      In this paper, we propose the use of a Software Transactional Memory to
      implement a Dynamic Software Upgrade system that combines two desirable
      properties.  First, it provides a simple semantics to the developer, while
      allowing upgrades to occur atomically, concurrently with the execution of the
      program.  Second, it converts the program’s data lazily, as data is
      progressively accessed by the execution of the upgraded program.  We present
      also experimental results that show that our lazy approach to software upgrades
      is able to upgrade a system without affecting significantly the maximum response
      time of the system’s operations, whereas an immediate approach shows values of
      maximum response time up to three orders of magnitude higher.

      Over the last years, multicores have become accessible to the common
      developer.  Writing concurrent programs that are correct and that display good
      performance is hard.  Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a step in the
      direction of solving the first problem, but it does not provide tools for the
      programmer to understand and optimize his code's performance, thus leaving the
      second problem as an open issue.
      
      In this paper, we present a novel technique that informs the developer about
      which objects cause JVSTM transactions to conflict.  Then, we describe how we
      used that technique together with several JVSTM conflict reduction techniques to
      improve the performance of a transactional application.

    The upgrade of a running program is often a disruptive operation that
    involves stopping and restarting the program's execution. Yet, software upgrades
    are unavoidable. Unfortunately, current solutions for dynamic upgrades are
    either incomplete or not practical. Systems that have high availability
    requirements implement upgrades through a combination of application-specific
    software and redundant hardware. However, such systems lack support to migrate
    the state of the running program to a state that is compatible with the program
    that the upgrade introduces. Typically, they migrate the persisted data only and
    the data migration process may impose a long pause on the application.
    
    To ensure the atomicity of the upgrade and data migration operations, but still
    allow them to execute in parallel with the rest of the system, thereby avoiding
    the restart of the system or long pauses, I introduce a conceptual model that
    defines the semantics of the upgrade system, and that may be implemented with
    any STM and programming language. Furthermore, the upgrade system that I propose
    and the data migration process can be integrated seamlessly with modern software
    engineering methodologies. I describe an implementation of the proposed upgrade
    system for the Java platform that uses JVSTM. I implemented a prototype of the
    upgrade system that is able to perform a significant number of different types
    of upgrades to a running Java application without stopping it, providing thus a
    proof of concept that the implementation of the upgrade system is feasible.
