I am a final year [PhD candidate on Information Systems and Computer
Engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic?locale=en_EN)	at
Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon.

I developed my thesis work on [Dynamic Software
Updating (DSU)](dsu.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Michael
Hicks](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/) and Prof. [Luís
Veiga](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~lveiga/).

Currently, I have a post-doctoral position at the [SRG
Group](http://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at Imperial College London.  I was part of the
[PLUM group](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/) at University of Maryland from
2012 to 2015, and part of the [ESW
group](http://www.esw.inesc-id.pt/cgi-bin/moin.cgi) at INESC-ID in Lisbon from
2009 to 2012.
